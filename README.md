# CS245_Principle_Data_Science
This is the online code repo for the class CS245 taught in SJTU by Prof. Li Niu. 

Lab 1 and lab 2 are done by Xiang Gu and Tao Zhu;
Lab 3 is done by Weihong Lin;
Lab 4 is done by Chacha Chen.

Since the labs are finished by different students, the usage of code is different.
For lab 1 and lab2, simply download the AwA2-features file from https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/ and put it into the lab 1 or lab 2 directory. Then you will be able to run those jupyter notebooks for each lab.

**For lab 3, Weihong, could you please write down how to set up in order to run your code and reproduce your results?**

**For lab 4, Chacha, could you please write down how to set up in order to run your code and reproduce your results?**
